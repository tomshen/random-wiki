random-wiki
===========
My roommate and I were discussing how to find new, interesting topics of conversation. Of course, Wikipedia's random page came up, and I bet my roommate I could make a script for it in an hour. Although I failed the original challenge, by the end of the night we had created a fully functional website.

This is the code behind [random-wiki.appspot.com](http://random-wiki.appspot.com). Visitors can enter their email addresses to subscribe to daily emails. Every morning at 5 am EST, an email is sent out to each subscriber with the title and first paragraph of a random Wikipedia article, as well as a link to the article in question.
