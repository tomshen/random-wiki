===========
This is the code behind [random-wiki.appspot.com](http://random-wiki.appspot.com). Visitors can enter their emails to subscribe. Every morning at 5 am EST, an email is sent to each subscriber with the title and first paragraph of a random Wikipedia article, as well as a link to the article in question.

For now, keep in mind this was hacked together in a few hours, and is still a work in progress.
